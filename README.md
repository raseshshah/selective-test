# selective-test
This plugin works by analyzing the changes made to your codebase and selecting a test plan that is specifically tailored to those changes. This ensures that only the necessary tests are run, saving time and resources.

The static analysis performed by the plugin is based on the code changes themselves, rather than relying on manual input from the developer. This makes the process more efficient and less error-prone.

Overall, this Maven plugin is a valuable tool for developers who want to streamline their testing process and ensure that only the necessary tests are run for each code change.
